# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

A Claude Code plugin (`dev`) that automates WBS-based TDD development cycles. It provides 10 skills installable via the Claude Code plugin system (`/plugin install dev@dev-tools`). The plugin namespace is `dev:`.

## Architecture

```
.claude-plugin/          # Plugin metadata (plugin.json, marketplace.json)
skills/                  # Each subdirectory = one skill (SKILL.md is the entry point)
scripts/                 # Token-saving helper scripts (bash)
README.md                # User-facing documentation
```

### Helper Scripts (Token Optimization)

Skills delegate deterministic work to Python scripts (cross-platform: Mac/Linux/Windows) to reduce LLM token consumption:

| Script | Purpose | Used by |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `scripts/wbs-parse.py` | WBS task/WP extraction → JSON output | dev, dev-design/build/test/refactor, dev-team, wp-setup.py |
| `scripts/args-parse.py` | Argument parsing + subproject detection → JSON | dev, dev-design/build/test/refactor, dev-team |
| `scripts/dep-analysis.py` | Dependency level calculation (topological sort) → JSON | dev-team, agent-pool, team-mode |
| `scripts/signal-helper.py` | Atomic signal file create/check/wait | dev-team, team-mode, agent-pool, DDTR workers |
| `scripts/wp-setup.py` | Worktree + prompt + tmux setup | dev-team |
| `scripts/wbs-update-status.py` | WBS Task status update (atomic replace) | dev-design, dev-build, dev-refactor |
| `scripts/cleanup-orphaned.py` | Orphaned test process cleanup (vitest/tsc) | dev (Phase transition) |
| `scripts/_platform.py` | Cross-platform utilities (temp dir, JSON escape) | all scripts |

All scripts use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/` as base path. Python 3 standard library only — no pip dependencies.

### Skill Layers

**Layer 1 — Generic parallel engines** (no WBS dependency):
- `agent-pool`: N subagents in one session, slot-pool pattern with signal files (`/tmp/agent-pool-signals-{timestamp}/`). No tmux needed.
- `team-mode`: N independent claude processes in tmux panes, signal-file based task dispatch and pane recycling. Requires tmux.

**Layer 2 — WBS development lifecycle** (operates on `docs/wbs.md` Tasks):
- `wbs`: PRD/TRD → WBS generation (3-level or 4-level based on project scale)
- `dev`: Orchestrator — runs design→build→test→refactor as sequential subagents for a single Task
- `dev-design`, `dev-build`, `dev-test`, `dev-refactor`: Individual phase skills

**Layer 3 — Team parallel development** (combines Layer 1 + Layer 2):
- `dev-team`: Distributes WP's Tasks across team-mode workers. Each worker runs the full DDTR cycle. Uses git worktrees per WP, merges back to main.

### Key Patterns

- **Signal files**: All inter-agent communication uses file-based signals (`.done` files). Absolute paths are mandatory in worktree contexts.
- **DDTR cycle**: Design `[dd]` → TDD Build `[im]` → Test → Refactor `[xx]` — status tracked in `docs/wbs.md`.
- **Pane recycling** (team-mode): After a worker completes a task, send `/clear` then assign the next task via `tmux send-keys` with prompt files (never inline — tmux truncates long strings).
- **Slot-pool** (agent-pool): Maintain exactly N concurrent agents; when one completes, immediately launch the next eligible task.
- **Templates**: `skills/dev-design/template.md`, `skills/dev-test/template.md`, `skills/dev-refactor/template.md` define output formats for each phase.

## Skill File Convention

Each skill is a directory under `skills/` containing a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: "Trigger description — also used for natural language matching"
---
```

The `description` field doubles as NL trigger keywords (e.g., "팀모드", "team mode", "에이전트 풀"). Arguments are passed via `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Domain-Specific Test Commands

Skills reference these based on the Task's `domain` field:
- `backend` unit: `bundle exec rspec --exclude-pattern "spec/features/**/*,spec/system/**/*"`
- `backend` E2E: `bundle exec rspec spec/features spec/system`
- `frontend` unit: `npm run test`
- `frontend` E2E: `npm run test:e2e` (Missing script → `npx playwright test`)
- `sidecar` unit: `uv run pytest -m "not e2e"`
- `sidecar` E2E: `uv run pytest -m e2e`
- `fullstack`: backend → frontend → sidecar sequential (fail-fast)
- `database` / `infra` / `docs`: N/A

## Target Project Requirements

The plugin expects the consuming project to have:
- `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/TRD.md`, `docs/wbs.md`
- WBS Tasks formatted as `### TSK-XX-XX:` with metadata (category, domain, status, depends, etc.)
- Task artifacts go to `docs/tasks/{TSK-ID}/` (design.md, test-report.md, refactor.md)

## dev-team Execution Modes

- **tmux present**: Creates git worktree per WP, spawns WP leader as tmux window, leader manages worker panes via team-mode protocol. Supports early merge (merge completed WPs while others are still running).
- **tmux absent**: Falls back to Agent tool with `isolation: "worktree"` and `run_in_background: true`, using agent-pool slot management.
